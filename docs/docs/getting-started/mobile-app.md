# Mobile App

My initial plan was to release the app via Google Play. In the process of
getting setup; however, I was made aware of multiple requirements that I
take issue with as an independent developer:

1. In order to publish an application, you have to have 20 users utilize the
   app every day for 14 days before being able to _apply_ for a public release.
2. The developer address - aka my home address - would be published with the
   listing

Because of these requirements, I've decided to make the APKs available through
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/Demetrioz/Hyperion/releases) instead.

## Installation

### Android

1. Download the approporiate APK from the
   [Releases Page](https://github.com/Demetrioz/Hyperion/releases)
2. Tap the downloaded APK to install, and allow any needed permissions
3. Open Hyperion and navigate to the Settings tab
4. Enter the connection details for your MQTT broker and click save
